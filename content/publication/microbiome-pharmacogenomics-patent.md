abstract = "Embodiments of a method and system for microbial pharmacogenomics can include: a sample handling system operable to collect containers including biological samples from a set of users, the handling system including a sequencing system operable to determine microorganism sequences from the biological samples; a microbiome characterization system operable to: determine microbiome pharmacogenomics data based on the microorganism sequences, collect supplementary data associated with the antibiotics-associated condition for the set of users, and transform the supplementary data and features extracted from the microbiome pharmacogenomics data into a characterization model associated with the antibiotics-associated condition; and a treatment system operable to promote a treatment to the user for the antibiotics-associated condition based on characterizing user biological material with the characterization model in relation to the antibiotics-associated condition."
