abstract = "Recent studies suggest an overlap in genetic susceptibility of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (BD). There is some evidence for association of the DTNBP1 gene with schizophrenia. Several studies have investigated the association between the DTNP1 and BD providing conflicting results. These studies have used a different set of genetic markers that makes a direct comparison of risk alleles/haplotypes impossible. The aim of the present study is to review and summarize the available data and provide a better overview of the role of the DTNBP1 in BD."
